		<p>

		population by providing shelter, education, nutrition, worship, healthcare, and agriculture
		throughout that community.

		</p>
		<p>

Pastor Pierre D. Jeune is well equipped to operate our organization and is knowledgeable of the needs of Haiti for he was born in Haiti and has traveled there extensively.  His spirit of service and experience in social work with children and adults contribute to his ability to operate Think About a Child Organization.

By offering life-changing services for these underserved population groups, we believe Think About a Child Organization can contribute to reversing the devastating trends of poverty, poor health, lack of sustainability, and hunger throughout Haiti.

	  <h2>III.	Problem Statement</h2>  
		<p>
		Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, is plagued by violence, hunger, unrelenting extreme poverty, disease, high unemployment rates, low life expectancy and crumbling health and educational systems.  Haiti is a beautiful country but even the beautiful sunsets and green mountains can not hide the poverty.  Most families live in crowed homes made of cardboard and tin.
		</p>
		<p>
	There is no running water and little or no electricity.  Urban slums teem with garbage, sewage and people.  There is never enough food.  Women and children are always hungry.  Illness and disease are common, especially among children, as more than half the population has no access to Western medicine.  Unemployment ranges from 60% to 70%; those with jobs earn a minimum wage of just $1.50 a day.
		</p>

		<p>
	The education system is partly to blame for some of the problems facing Haitians.  The schools were established shortly after the Constitution of 1805, which mandated free and compulsory primary education.  The Education Act of 1848 created rural primary schools with a limited, mostly agricultural curriculum.  While education was promoted, accessible school system never developed because of the post-colonial leaders.
		</p>
		<p>
	Today, the majority received no formal education and only a small minority are educated beyond primary school.   In recent years, there have been efforts to reform the educational system and to make education more accessible to the poor and more relevant to their needs.  The reforms, however, have been only partly successful at best and much of the old system remains in place throughout the country.  Despite the reforms, obtaining an education remains an elusive goal for most in Haiti.  Although education is highly valued, the majority do not have access to it.  The enrollment rate for primary school is 67%, of which less than 30% reach 6th grade.  Secondary schools enroll 20% of eligible-age children.  The literacy rate is about 53% falls well below the 90% average literacy rate for Latin American and Caribbean countries. .
		</p>

		<p>
	Even though education is technically free in Haiti, it remains beyond the means of most Haitians, who cannot afford the supplemental fees, school supplies, and uniforms required.  Reform measures, especially the use of Haitian Creole, have met resistance.  
	Thus, education remains a privilege of the upper and middle classes, with fluency in French a marker of success.

		<p>
	Although plans for further implementation of reforms have not been abandoned, the current economic and political crises in Haiti have overshadowed educational concerns.  Help the Children seeks to respond to the needs of Haiti’s youth.  Through the consistent and effective provision of social services and educational support, the organization hopes to be a change-agent in the lives of impoverished individual
		</p>
		<p>
		Because of Haiti’s high population density and its decaying infrastructure, the country is particularly vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters such as floods, mudslides, hurricanes, and earthquake, such as the devastating earthquake that occurred in Port-au-Prince in January 2010.

  <h2>	Some of the issues facing children include the following:</h2>  
	<ul>
		<li>
			Highest rates of infant, under five and maternal mortality in the Western hemisphere.  Diarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, and HIV/AIDS are the leading causes of death.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sixty percent of people, primarily in rural areas, lack access to basic health care services.
		</li>
		<li>
			Numerous schools and hospitals have closed because teachers, social workers and health providers could not go to work for fear of violence.
		</li>
		<li>
			About 5.6 percent of people between the ages 15-49 years old are living with 
		</li>
		<li>
		HIV/AIDS in Haiti.  This includes about 19,000 children.  Antiretroviral drugs are extremely scarce.
		</li>
		<li>
			As many as 2,000 children a year are trafficked to the Dominican Republic, often with their parents’ support.
		</li>
		<li>
			Only a little over half of primary school-aged children are enrolled in school.  Less than 2 percent of children finish secondary school.
		</li>
		<li>
			Approximately 1,000 children are working as messengers, spies and even -soldiers for armed gangs in Port-Au-Prince.
